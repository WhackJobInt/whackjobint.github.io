It allows for a much easier and faster time doing missions and AI rather than messing around in C++ and doing logic entirely through map entities in Hammer. With Postal3Script, you can easily do many things that you normally would not be able to do without the source code of the game due to the many useful functions and attributes that are interfaced. P3S script files are located in Postal III/p3/scripts and use the .p3s file extension, but it can be any extension if wanted. To load and be able to use a p3s script, you must add it to a manifest, in \"ai_scripts.txt\", found in the previously mentioned folder. HERE you can download the contents of Postal 3's scripts folder, if you need it for researching purposes, or else. Tip Changes to p3s scripts will automatically hotload when the map restarts, so you can just use the \"restart\" console command without ever having to exit and reload the game. It is highly recommended to snoop around the game files and find examples of what you're trying to accomplish to get a better idea of the language.

Ignoring these limitations will make your script behave oddly, and unexpectedly. In Postal3Script, Attributes can only be whole numbers/integers, attributes can't be floats, doubles, or strings. However, the Wait and Repeat functions are the only exception where you can freely use floats. An Attribute must have a value initialized before checking it's value using CheckAttr , meaning an attribute that doesn't exist will never return a valid value. (Checking if it's zero/null doesn't work). Extremely sensitive to spaces when using parameters for functions, this can lead to unexpected behavior. Errors in a script file won't show up without enabling a console command first, and most of the time it's not obvious if the code is working fine. Postal3Script function names are case-sensitive, i.e. it's not recommended to use ifattr instead of IfAttr .","title":"What is Postal3Script?"},{"location":"whatispostal3script/#what-is-postal3script","text":"Postal3Script, or P3S, is a Finite State Machine (FSM) and a scripting language developed for Postal 3, designed to handle most of the NPC AI and mission scripting.
